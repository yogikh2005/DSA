# ðŸš€ DSA Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problem-solving journey. I have solved problems across various topics such as strings, arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs using **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.

Each subdirectory contains implementations of standard and advanced problems for that topic using the respective language.

## ðŸ›  Languages Used

- **C**
- **C++**
- **Java**

## âœ… Topics Covered

- **Array**: Searching, Sorting, Sliding Window, Prefix Sum, Two Pointers
- **String**: Pattern Matching, Palindromes, Substrings, String Manipulation
- **Stack**: Infix/Postfix, Balanced Parentheses, Monotonic Stack
- **Queue**: Circular Queue, Deque, Sliding Window Maximum
- **Linked List**: Singly, Doubly, Circular, Reversal, Detect Loop
- **Tree**: Traversals (DFS/BFS), BST, Binary Tree, Tree Diameter
- **Graph**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, Union Find, Topological Sort

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yogikh2005/dsa-problem-solving.git
   cd dsa-problem-solving

2. Navigate into the directory of the language and topic:
   ```bash
   cd Java/Array 
   ```
3. For C:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
4. For C++
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
5. For Java
   ```bash
   javac Filename.java
   java Filename
```
